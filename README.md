# Java 2 Rust 

Author: Cesar Augusto Guzman Alvarez [@cguz](https://github.com/cguz/)

## Description

This is a shell version of the [web-application](https://github.com/aschoerk/converter-page). From now, all the credits for the original author of the web-application.

The application is a small help when trying to port Java-Code to Rust.

The author is a beginner in rust, so the generated code will sometimes be kind of "unrusty".

## How to use it.

$ java -jar java-2-rust.jar [path_file.java | path_directory]

The converted files will be saved in the folder: "output"

## Implemented Functions

 Same functionalities as the [web-application](https://github.com/aschoerk/converter-page).
